## ☀️ Introduction

‘Weather Web App' is a responsive and accessible web application that provides users with real-time weather information, air quality updates, and a rain radar map.

---

## ☀️ Brief

The Code Institutes learning objectives for this project were as follows:

☁️ O1: Learners will be able to design and implement a one-page interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript focusing on user experience design, accessibility, and responsive DOM manipulation.<br>
<br>
☁️ O2: Learners will be able to test and validate a one-page web application through development, implementation, and deployment stages.<br>
<br>
☁️ O3: Learners will be able to deploy a one-page web application to a Cloud platform ensuring functionality and security.<br>
<br>
☁️ O4: Learners will be able to maximize future maintainability through thorough documentation, clear code structure, and organization.<br>
<br>
☁️ O5: Learners will be able to implement and document front-end interactivity using core JavaScript, JavaScript libraries, or frameworks with a focus on DOM manipulation for a one-page web application.<br>
<br>
☁️ O6: Learners will be able to leverage AI tools to orchestrate the software development process.

## ☀️ User Stories

 ### ❄️ Must haves
 ☁️ As a user, I want to view the current weather for my location, so I can decide what to wear or whether to bring an umbrella.<br>
 ☁️ As a planner, I want to view a 7-day weather forecast, so I can view a 7-day weather forecast<br>
 ☁️ As a user, I want to search for weather in different cities, so I can check conditions for places I plan to travel.<br>
☁️ As a mobile user, I want the weather page to adjust neatly to my screen size, so I can easily use it on the go.<br>
☁️ As a visually impaired user, I want to navigate the site using screen readers and keyboard shortcuts, so the experience is inclusive.<br>

 ### ❄️ Should Haves
 ☁️ As a commuter, I want to see a live rain radar map, so I can plan my walk or drive accordingly.<br>
 ☁️ As a curious user, I want to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, so I can view temperatures in my preferred format.<br>
☁️ As a weather enthusiast, I want to see animated transitions (like clouds or droplets) based on live conditions, so the site feels dynamic and engaging.<br>

 ### ❄️ Could Haves
☁️ As a user, I want to receive an alert when air quality reaches a poor level, so I can take precautions.<br>
☁️ As a health-conscious user, I want to see the local air quality index (AQI) with colour-coded warnings, so I can avoid going outside during unsafe conditions.<br>
